'''
This is a finance calculator project. It allows users to choose beteween bond or investment.
Based on the users choice, the program will calculate either a "simple" or a "compound" interest,
and do the appropriate calculation and display the result.
In the case of a bond, the program will calculate how much a user will have to repay each
month and output the answer.
